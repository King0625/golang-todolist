# Golang todo list (TBD)

This is the repository for my first golang API project.

- Built in Go version 1.23
- Run through Docker & docker compose
  - docker version 28.0
- Uses the standard `net/http` library
- Uses `go-sql-driver/mysql` as my DB driver
- Uses `golang-jwt` for authentication
- Uses `joho/godotenv` for loading env file
- Uses `golang.org/x/crypto` for password hashing
- Uses `golang-migrate/migrate/v4` for DB migration
- MORE TO COME...
